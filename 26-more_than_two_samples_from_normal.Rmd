- Conduct appropriate "post-hoc" tests. 





## Setup   



We often have more than two groups. For example - we might want to know, not just if a fertilizer is better than a control, but which of a number of fertilizers have different impacts on plant growth. 



Or for the extended example in this chapter, if ambient temperature can influence body temperature in rodents, like the round-tailed ground squirrel, *Spermophilus tereticaudus*. In this experiment, @wooden2004 put squirrels in environments that where  <span style="color: Blue;"> 10째C (cold)</span>,  <span style="color: Orange;">  35째C (warm)</span>, and <span style="color: Red;">45째C  (hot)</span>, and measured their body temperature.   The data are plotted in 

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
sqrl <- read.csv("data/sqrl.csv") 
```

```{r, fig.height=1.97, fig.width=3.5, fig.show='hold'}
# first lets order data from coldest to warmest for a pretty plot
sqrl <- mutate(sqrl, ambient_temp = fct_relevel(ambient_temp, "cold", "warm", "hot"))

ggplot(sqrl, aes(x = ambient_temp, y = body_temp, color  = ambient_temp))+
  geom_jitter(height = 0, width = .2, size = 2, alpha = .35, show.legend = FALSE)+
  stat_summary(fun.data = "mean_cl_normal", geom = "errorbar", width = .2, color = "black")+
  scale_color_manual(values = c("blue", "orange", "red"))

```

### Review: Linear models  

We can, and will, think about this like a linear model.  

```{r}
sqrl_lm <- lm( body_temp ~ ambient_temp, data = sqrl)
sqrl_lm
```

We can write down the linear equation as follows:   

\begin{equation} 
\begin{split}\text{body temp}_i = 30.960 +  6.254  \times WARM  + 10 \times hot
\end{split}
(\#eq:sqrllm)
\end{equation} 

And we can find the predicted body temperature for each ambient temperature as follows:   

\begin{equation} 
\begin{split}
\hat{Y}_\text{Cold ambient} &= 30.960 +  6.254  \times WARM  + 10 \times HOT.  \\  
&= 30.960 +  6.254  \times 0  + 10 \times 0 . \\
  &= 30.960 \\  \\
\hat{Y}_\text{Warm ambient} &= 30.960 +  6.254  \times WARM  + 10 \times HOT.  \\  
&= 30.960 +  6.254  \times 1  + 10 \times 0 . \\
  &= 30.960 +  6.254 \\ 
  & =37.214\\ \\
\hat{Y}_\text{Hot ambient} &= 30.960 +  6.254  \times WARM  + 10 \times HOT.  \\  
&= 30.960 +  6.254  \times 0  + 10 \times 1 . \\
  &= 30.960 +  10 \\ 
  & =40.960 \\
\end{split}
(\#eq:sqreq)
\end{equation}

So that's all good, and equals the means, as we would like

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
sqrl %>%
  group_by(ambient_temp) %>%
  summarise(mean_body_temp = mean(body_temp))                                                                           %>% kable(digits = 4)
```

**But the t-values and p-values are weird**   
 
```{r}
tidy(sqrl_lm)                                                                                     %>% kable(digits = 4)
```

Specifically, we have three pairs of p and t values.  

- t and p values associated with`(Intercept)` ($t = 267$, $2.32 \times 10^{-91}$), describe the nonsense null hypothesis that mean temperature in cold is 0째C. 
- t and p values  associated with`ambient_tempwarm` ($t = 39.7$, $4.16 \times 10^{-43}$), describe the null hypothesis that would be useful to evaluate -- that mean body  temperature does not differ in cold vs. warm environments.    
- t and p values  associated with`ambient_temphot` ($t = 61.1$, $2.40 \times 10^{-54}$), describe the null hypothesis that would be useful to evaluate -- that mean body  temperature does not differ in warm vs. hot environments.     

**What's wrong with the p-values above?**  

1.  **We have not compared body temperatures at warm vs hot ambient temperatures.**      
2. **We have conducted "multiple tests"** on the same data set. That is because we have two p-values we're looking at, the probability that we incorrectly reject at least one true null is no longer $\alpha$, but is the probability of not rejecting any null hypotheses $1-(1 -\alpha)^\text{n tests}$. So with the two interesting null hypotheses to test, with a traditional $\alpha = 0.05$ the probability of not reject any true null hypotheses is $1-(1 -.05)^2 = 0.0975$. This is way bigger than the $\alpha$ of $0.05$ we claim to have.  

### Why not all paiwise t-tests?  

We could solve the first issue by conducting three two-sample t-tests. But this exacerbates the second issue -- now our probability of at least one false negative is $1-(1-0.05)^3 = .143$.

```{r}
bind_rows(
  t.test(body_temp ~ ambient_temp , filter(sqrl, ambient_temp != "hot"), var.equal  = TRUE) %>% 
       tidy() %>% mutate(comp = "cold v warm") %>% dplyr::select(comp, p.value, t = statistic),
    t.test(body_temp ~ ambient_temp , filter(sqrl, ambient_temp != "warm"), var.equal  = TRUE) %>% 
       tidy() %>% mutate(comp = "cold v hot") %>% dplyr::select(comp, p.value, t = statistic),
    t.test(body_temp ~ ambient_temp , filter(sqrl, ambient_temp != "cold"), var.equal  = TRUE) %>% 
       tidy() %>% mutate(comp = "warm v hot") %>% dplyr::select(comp, p.value, t = statistic))                                                                                  %>% mutate(p.value = paste(round(p.value * 10^c(31,41,24),digits = 2),c("x10^-31","x10^-41","x10^-24"), sep=""))%>% kable(digits = 4)
```



### More on multiple testing  

```{r jellybeans, fig.cap = "The multiple testing problem according to [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/882/). rollover test: '*So, uh, we did the green study again and got no link. It was probably a-- RESEARCH CONFLICTED ON GREEN JELLY BEAN/ACNE LINK; MORE STUDY RECOMMENDED!*'", echo=FALSE, out.width="40%", out.extra='style="float:right;padding-left: 30px"'}
include_graphics("https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/significant.png")
```

This [classic xkcd comic](https://xkcd.com/882/) provides a great cartoon of the multiple testing problem, as well as the problem of science hype and communication.  If we repeatedly test true null hypotheses we're bound to reject some by chance. 

This is a potential problem when looking at differences between groups, as the number of pairwise test rapidly expand with the number of groups. How rapidly, you ask? Let's revisit the binomial equation, where $k$ is 2 (because we make pairs of two) and we have $n$ groups.   


\begin{equation} 
\begin{split}
\binom{n}{2} &= \frac{n!}{(n-k)! \times 2!}  \\
 &= \frac{n\times (n-1) \times (n-2)!}{(n-2)\times 2!} \\
 &= \frac{n\times (n-1) }{2} 
 \end{split}
(\#eq:n2)
\end{equation}

So, with $n$ groups we have $n(n-1)/2$ pairwise comparisons, and a probability of rejecting at least one true null of $1-(1-0.05)^{n(n-1)/2}$. So all pairwise tests with fifteen groups is 105 tests, and we're  basically assured at least one will be a false positive.

```{r, fig.height=1.8, fig.width=4.5, echo=FALSE}
dat <- tibble(n_groups = 1:15, 
              n_tests =n_groups *(n_groups-1)/2 ,
              p_no_false_pos = 1- (1-0.05)^n_tests)


a <- ggplot(dat, aes(x = n_groups, y =  n_tests))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_line(lty = 2)

b <- ggplot(dat, aes(x = n_groups, y =  p_no_false_pos))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_line(lty = 2)
plot_grid(a,b)
```


## The ANOVA's solution to the multiple testing problem  

Instead of testing each combination of groups, the ANOVA poses a different null hypothesis.  The ANOVA tests the null hypothesis that all samples come from the same statistical population.  

**ANOVA hypotheses**  

- $H_0$: All samples come from the same (statistical) population. Practically, this says that all groups have the same mean.  
- $H_A$: Not all samples come from the same (statistical) population.   Practically this says that not all groups have the same mean.


The ANOVA makes this null by some algebraic rearrangement of the sampling distribution. That is, the ANOVA tests the null hypothesis that all groups come from the same (statistical) population based on the expected variance of estimates from the sampling distribution!!   

### Mathemagic of the ANOVA  



Recall that the standard error of the mean ($\sigma_{\overline{Y}}$) of a sample of size $n$ from a normal sampling distribution is the standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size:  $\sigma_{\overline{Y}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$.  


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="30%", out.extra='style="float:left;padding-right: 20px"'}
include_graphics("https://media.giphy.com/media/3orif8Epddpd8KSELe/giphy.gif")
```

With some algebra (squaring both sides and multiplying both side by n), we see that the sample size times the variance among groups $n \times \sigma_{\overline{Y}}^2$  equals the variance within groups $\sigma^2$ (Equation \@ref(eq:seanova)).


\begin{equation} 
\begin{split}
\sigma_{\overline{Y}} = \sigma / \sqrt{n} \\
\sigma_{\overline{Y}}^2 = \sigma^2 / n \\
n \times \sigma_{\overline{Y}}^2 = \sigma^2 
 \end{split}
(\#eq:seanova)
\end{equation}

- So, if all groups come from the same population (i.e. under the null hypothesis), $n \times \sigma_{\overline{Y}}^2$ will equal the variance within groups $\sigma^2$.   

- If all groups do not come from the same population (i.e. under the alternative hypothesis), $n \times \sigma_{\overline{Y}}^2$ will exceed the variance within groups $\sigma^2$.    


### Parameters and estimates in an ANOVA {#ANOVAests}

So we can turn these ideas into parameters to estimate. 

| Source | Parameter | Estimate | Notation |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| Among Groups  | $n \times \sigma_Y^2$ | Mean squares model | $MS_{model}$ |
| Within Groups | $\sigma^2_Y$ | Mean squares error | $MS_{error}$ |
| Total         | $n \times \sigma_Y^2 + \sigma^2_Y$ | Mean squares total   | $MS_{total}$  |

So with this new math and algebra we can restate our null and alternative hypotheses for an ANOVA  

- $H_0$: Mean squares model is not greater than mean squares error (i.e. among group variance equals zero).

- $H_A$: Mean squares model is greater than mean squares error (i.e. among group variance is not zero).


```{block2, type='rmdnote'}
**NOTE:** I call $n \times \sigma_Y^2$ *mean squares model*. A more common name for this is *mean squares error*. I call this *mean squares model* to emphasize that this is the same calcualtion we will do for all linear models. 
```

a <- ggplot(mutate(sqrl, id = 1:n(), mean_temp = mean(body_temp)) , 
            aes(x = id, y = body_temp, color = ambient_temp))+
  geom_point(alpha = .5)+
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = mean_temp))+
  geom_segment(aes( xend = id, yend = mean_temp ), 
               color = "black", alpha = .5)+
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(), axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.ticks.x = element_blank())+ 
  labs(title = "Total deviation               = ")+
  scale_color_manual(values = c("blue", "orange", "red"))

          aes(x = id, y = body_temp, color = ambient_temp))+
  geom_point(alpha = .5)+
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = mean_temp))+
  geom_segment(aes( xend = id,y = .fitted,  yend = mean_temp ), 
               color = "black", alpha = .5)+
    geom_line(aes(y = .fitted), alpha  = 2)+ 
    theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(), axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.ticks.x = element_blank())+ 
  labs(title = "Model deviation             +")+
  scale_color_manual(values = c("blue", "orange", "red"))

c<-ggplot(mutate(augment(sqrl_lm), id = 1:n(), mean_temp = mean(body_temp)) ,
          aes(x = id, y = body_temp, color = ambient_temp))+
  geom_point(alpha = .5)+
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = mean_temp))+
  geom_segment(aes( xend = id,  yend = .fitted),

           get_legend(a+theme(legend.position = "bottom")), 
                      ncol = 1, rel_heights = c(1,.1))
```

Figure \@ref(fig:varpart), really helps me understand what we're doing in ANOVA -- we think about all variability in our data (**a**) as the sum of the variability among (**b**), and within groups.  To do so, we first square the length of each line in Figure \@ref(fig:varpart), and add them up. These are called the sums of squares. 

```{r}
sums_of_squares <- augment(sqrl_lm) %>%
  mutate(grand_mean  = mean(body_temp)) %>%
  summarise(n_groups = n_distinct(ambient_temp) ,
            n        = n(),
            ss_total = sum((body_temp - grand_mean)^2),
            ss_model = sum((.fitted   - grand_mean)^2),
            ss_error = sum((body_temp - .fitted)^2)) # or we could have just had sum(.resid^2)

sums_of_squares                                                                                                        %>% kable(digits = 2)
``` 

Or in math   

-   **Sums of squares total**: $SS_{total} = \sum{(Y_i-\overline{\overline{Y})}}$, where $Y_i$ is the value of the $i^{th}$ individual's response variable, and $\overline{\overline{Y})}$. This is familiar as the numerator of the variance.  
-   **Sums of squares model** (aka sums of squares groups): $SS_{model} = \sum{(\widehat{Y_i}-\overline{\overline{Y})}}$, where $\widehat{Y_i}$ is the predicted value of the $i^{th}$ individual's response variable.
-   **Sums of squares error** (aka sums of squares residual): $SS_{model} = \sum{e_i^2}$, where $e_i^2$ is the $i^{th}$ individual's residual deviation from its predicted value.  

### $r^2 = \frac{SS_{model}}{SS_{total}}$ as the "proportion variance explained" 

We now have a great summary of the effect size, as the proportion of variance explained by our model $r^2 = \frac{SS_{model}}{SS_{total}}$.  For the squirrel example $r^2 = \frac{1021.7}{1037.2} =0.985$. Or in R 

```{r}
sums_of_squares %>%
  mutate(r2 = ss_model / ss_total)                                                                                                   %>% kable(digits = 4)
```

This is remarkably high -- **in this experiment** ambient temperature explains 98.5% of the variation in squirrel body temperature. 

`r ji("warning")`**WARNING**`r ji("warning")` $r^2$ is a nice summary of the effect size in a given study, but **cannot be extrapolated to  beyond that  experiment**. Importantly $r^2$ depends on the relative size of each sample, and the factors they experience. 

- <span style="color: Red;"> **It's WRONG to say** </span> *Ambient temperature explains 98.5% of variance in round-tailed ground squirrel body temperature.*    
- <span style="color: Blue;"> **It's RIGHT to say** </span> *In a study of 61 round-tailed ground squirrels, <span style="color: Blue;"> (20 at 10째C (cold)</span>, <span style="color: Orange;">21 at   35째C (warm)</span>, and <span style="color: Red;"> 20 at 45째C  (hot)</span>), @wooden2004 found that ambient temperature explained 98.5% of variance in round-tailed ground squirrel body temperature.*   

### F as ANOVA's test statistic 

So $r^2$ is a (somewhat fragile) measure of effect size. But how do we know how often the null model would produce such an extreme result? We do so by comparing the test statistic, $F$ -- the mean squares model  ($MS_{model}$) divided by the mean squares error ($MS_{error}$) --  to its sampling distribution under the null.    

$$F  = \frac{MS_{model}}{MS_{error}}$$

We introduced $MS_{model}$ as an estimate of the parameter $n \times \sigma_Y^2$, and $MS_{error}$ as an estimate of the parameter $\sigma^2_Y$, in section \@ref(ANOVAests) above.  But how do we calculate them? Well, we take  calculate $SS_{model}$ and $SS_{error}$ and divide by their degrees of freedom.  

#### Calulating $MS_{groups}$ 

The degrees of freedom for the groups is the the number of groups minus one.  

\begin{equation} 
\begin{split}
df_{model} &= n_{groups} - 1\\
MS_{moedl} &= \frac{SS_{model}}{df_{model}} 
\end{split}
\end{equation} 

Recall that $SS_{model}=\sum(\widehat{Y_i} - \overline{\overline{Y}})^2$. 

<span style="color: LightGray;"> For fun we can alternatively calculate it as $SS_{model}=\sum(n_g \times (\widehat{Y_g} - \overline{\overline{Y}})^2)$. Where the subscript, $_g$ refers to the $g^{th}$ group, and the subscript, $_i$ refers to the $i^{th}$ individual.   </span>    

#### Calulating $MS_{error}$ 

The degrees of freedom for the error is the total sample size minus the number of groups.  

\begin{equation} 
\begin{split}
df_{error} &= n -n_{groups}\\
MS_{error} &= \frac{SS_{error}}{df_{error}}
\end{split}
\end{equation} 

Recall that $SS_{error}=\sum(Y_i - \overline{\overline{Y}})^2$. 

<span style="color: LightGray;">  For fun we can alternatively calculate it as $SS_{error}=\frac{\sum(s_g^2\times (n_g-1))}{n -n_{groups}}$   </span>  


```{block2, type='rmdnote'}
**NOTE:** If we only have two groups and ANOVA and two sample t-test give the same answers. One insight into this is to see that MS_error equals the pooled variance if we have two groups.  
```


### Calculating F 

Now finding $F$ is just a matter of dividing $MS_{model}$ by $MS_error$.  

```{r}
F_summary <- sums_of_squares  %>%
  mutate(df_model = n_groups - 1,
         df_error = n - n_groups,
         ms_model = ss_model / df_model,
         ms_error = ss_error / df_error,
         F_val    = ms_model / ms_error) %>%
  dplyr::select(-n, -n_groups)

F_summary                                                                                                                          %>% kable(digits = 4)
```




### Testing the null hypothesis that $F=1$   

We find a p-value by looking at the proportion of F's sampling distribution that is as or more extreme than our calculated F value. 

F take to different degrees of freedom, $df_{model}$ and $df_{error}$ in that order.  

Recal that all ways to be extreme are on the right tail of the F distribution -- so the alternative model is "F is greater than one", and we need not multiply our p-value by two.  

In R:  `pf(q = F_val, df1 = df_model, df2 = dr_error, lower.tail = FALSE)`   
  `pf(q = 1906, df1 = 2, df2 = 58, lower.tail = FALSE)`. The [`pf()`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/Fdist.html) function works like the `pnorm()`, `pt()` and `pchisq()` functions, as they all look for the probability that a random sample from the focal distribution will be as large as what we are asking about (if `lower.tail = FALSE`)  

```{r}
F_summary  %>%
  mutate(p_value = pf(q = F_val, df1 = df_model, df2 = df_error, lower.tail = FALSE))                                                                                                            %>% mutate(p_value = paste( round(p_value * 10^53, digits = 3),"x10^-53", sep="" ))%>% kable(digits = 4)
```


So we resoundingly reject the null model and conclude that ambient temperature is associated with elevated body temperature in the round-tailed ground squirrel. Because this was under experimental conditions, I think we can say that increasing ambient temperature directly or indirectly increases round-tailed ground squirrel body temperature.  

### Exploring F's sampling distribution and  critical values.

Play around with the values for the degrees of freedom and see how the F distribution changes.

## An ANOVA in R and understanding its output

Remember our linear model. Let's look at its  output from `summary.lm()`

```{r}
sqrl_lm <- lm( body_temp ~ ambient_temp, data = sqrl)
summary.lm(sqrl_lm)
```

We discussed the meaning and limitations of the `Estimate`, `Std. Error`, `t value`, and `Pr(>|t|)` (the p-value) above. We now also can interpret the R-squared value <span style="color: LightGray;"> (we'll worry about agjusted $r^2$ in a few weels)</span>, the F-statistic, its associated degrees of freedom, and the p-value. Reassuringly, these all match our math. We can look at these values in a tibble with the [`glance()`](https://generics.r-lib.org/reference/glance.html) function in the [broom](https://broom.tidymodels.org/) package. 

```{r}
glance(sqrl_lm)                                                                                                  %>% mutate(p.value = ifelse(is.na(p.value),NA,paste( round(p.value * 10^53, digits = 3),"x10^-53", sep="" ))) %>%kable(digits = 4)
```

### ANOVA tables   

The summary of the `lm()` output (which we access by `summary.lm()` or by `glance()`) is useful, but does not tell us about the variance partitions ($MS_{model}$ and $MS_{error}$) we calcualted to get these values. 

The [`anova()`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/anova.lm.html) function takes out put from a linear model and presents an ANOVA table

```{r}
anova(sqrl_lm)
```


We can pipe this to [`tidy()`](https://generics.r-lib.org/reference/tidy.html) if we prefer a tibble

```{r}
anova(sqrl_lm) %>% 
  tidy()                                                                                                                                             %>% mutate(p.value = ifelse(is.na(p.value),NA,paste( round(p.value * 10^53, digits = 3),"x10^-53", sep="" )))%>%kable(digits = 4)
```

Again we did our math right!!!!!


## Assumptions of an ANOVA 


**Remember that all linear models assume:** Linearity, Homoscedasticity, Independence, Normality (of residual values, or more specifically, of their sampling distribution), and that Data are collected without bias.  


### Assumptions of the anova  

We can ignore the linearity assumption for a two sample t-test.   
While we can never ignore bias or non-independence, we usually need more details of study design to get at them, so let's focus on homoscedasticity ans normality.

### The ANOVA asumes equal variance among groups

This makes sense a we used a mean squares error in the two sanova -- the very derivation if the ANOVA,  assumed that all groups have equal variance.  

- **Homoscedasticity** means that the variance of residuals is independent of the predicted value. In the case of our squirrels  we only make three predictions -- one per ambient temperature group -- so this essentially means that we assume equal variance in each group. 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
sqrl %>%
  group_by(ambient_temp) %>%
  summarise(variance = var(body_temp))                                                                                                                                                          %>% kable(digits = 4)
```

Because all these variances are within a factor of five,  we say that we're not severely violating the equal variance assumption. Like the two-ample t-test, the ANOVA is robust to minor violations of equal variance within groups.


### The ANOVA assumes normally disributed residuals  

Note this means we assume the differences from group means are  normally distributed, not that the raw data are.  

As we saw for a one and two sample t-test in Chapters \@ref(t) and \@ref(tsample), respectively, the ANOVA (like all linear models) is quite robust to this assumption, as we are actually assuming a normal sampling distribution of residuals, rather than a normal distribution of residuals.  

We could evaluate this assumption with the [`autoplot()`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggfortify/vignettes/plot_lm.html) function in the [`ggfortify`](https://github.com/sinhrks/ggfortify) package. But let's just do this our self by making a qqplot and by plotting a histogram of the residuals. 

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=2.5}
qq_sqrl <- augment(sqrl_lm) %>%
  ggplot(aes(sample = .resid))+
  geom_qq()+
  geom_qq_line()+ 
  labs(title = "qq plot of squirrel residuals")


hist_sqrl <- augment(sqrl_lm) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = .resid))+
  geom_histogram(bins = 12, color = "white") +
  labs(title = "Histogram of residuals")

assumption_plot <- plot_grid(qq_sqrl ,hist_sqrl, nrow = 1)

title <- ggdraw() + 
  draw_label("Evaluating normality assumptions for the squirrel temp data",   fontface = 'bold',x = 0,hjust = 0) +
  theme(plot.margin = margin(0, 0, 0, 20))

plot_grid( title, assumption_plot, ncol = 1,rel_heights = c(0.1, 1))
```



The data are obviously not normal (they look like maybe a uniform), as the small values are too big (above the qq line) and the big values too small (below the qq line) . But the sample size is pretty big, so I would feel comfortable assuming normality here.


## Alternatives to an ANOVA

If you think data do not meet assumptions you can  

- Consider this as a caveat when discussing your results, and think through how it could impact your inference.  
- Find a more appropriate test.   
- Write down your own likelihood function and conduct a [likelihood ratio test](https://bookdown.org/ybrandvain/Applied-Biostats/t.html#lklhd).    
-  Permute (but beware)

### Permuting as an alternative to the ANOVA based p-value  

If we violate the assumption of normal residuals we can permute our data and calculate F, and compare the observed F to its permuted distribution.   

The example below is silly because 

1. The central limit theorem should make our assumptions ok   and  
2. It's hard to imagine a slight deviation from normality resulting in a p-value of $10^{-53}$

But, I'm providing it to show you some fun tricks


```{r, eval=FALSE}
n_reps <- 1000

obs_f  <- glance(sqrl_lm) %>%
  pull(statistic)

perm_anova <- sqrl %>%
  rep_sample_n(size = nrow(sqrl), replace = FALSE, reps = n_reps)     %>% # copy the data
  mutate(ambient_temp = sample(ambient_temp, replace = FALSE))        %>% # shuffle labels
  nest(data = c(ambient_temp, body_temp))                             %>% # prepping data for many linear models
  mutate(fit = map(.x = data, ~ lm(.x$body_temp ~ .x$ambient_temp )),     # running many linear models -- one for each permutatatin
         results = map(fit, glance))                                  %>% # turn results into a tibble with glance()
  unnest(results)                                                     %>% #  make results easier to read
  ungroup()                                                           %>%
  dplyr::select(statistic)                                            %>% # grab the F value from permuted data           
  mutate(as_or_more = statistic >= obs_f)                             %>%
  summarise(p_val = mean(as_or_more))

```






```{block2, type='rmdnote'}
**NOTE:** Permuting DOES NOT solve the issue of unequal variance in groups. 
Why is that? it is because prmuting will huffle data between groups, resulting in an equal variance, so it doesnt solve this problem.  
```


## Post-hoc tests and significance groups


So if  we find that not all groups have the same mean, how do we know which means differ? The answer is in a "post-hoc test". We do a post-hoc test *if we reject the null*.

I first focus on "unplanned comparisons", in which we look at all pairs of groups, with no preconception of which may differ. 

### Unplanned comparisons

Post-hoc test gets over the multiple comparisons problem by conditioning on there being at least one difference and numerous pairwise tests,  and  altering its sampling distribution accordingly,

The Tukey-Kramer method, with test stat $q = \frac{Y_i-Y_j}{SE}$, where $SE = \sqrt{MS_{error}(\frac{1}{n_i}+ \frac{1}{n_j})}$ is one common approach to conduct unplanned post-hoc tests.   

To do this in R, we 

- Need to run our anova slightly differently, using the `aov()` function instead of `lm()` to make our model.    
- Pipe that output to the TukeyHSD() function

```{r}
aov( body_temp ~ ambient_temp, data = sqrl) %>%
  TukeyHSD()                                %>%
  tidy()                                                                                                                                           %>% mutate(adj.p.value = paste(round(adj.p.value * 10^11, digits = 3),"x10^-11",sep = ""))%>% kable(digits = 4)
```

We find that all pairwise comparisons differ. So we assign cold to significance group A, warm to significance group B and  and Hot to group C. 

We usually note significance groups on a plot 

```{r, fig.height=1.97, fig.width=3.5}
ggplot(sqrl, aes(x = ambient_temp, y = body_temp, color  = ambient_temp))+
  geom_jitter(height = 0, width = .2, size = 2, alpha = .35, show.legend = FALSE)+
  stat_summary(fun.data = "mean_cl_normal", geom = "errorbar", width = .2, color = "black")+
  scale_color_manual(values = c("blue", "orange", "red"))+
  geom_text(data = tibble(ambient_temp = c("cold","warm","hot"), 
                          body_temp     = c(31,37,41),
                          sig_group    = c("a","b","c")),
            aes(label = sig_group), nudge_x = .35, fontface = "bold", show.legend = FALSE)
```

Note significance groupings can be more challenging. For example, 

- If there was a treatment that for a "very cold" ambient temperature that did not significantly differ from "cold" it would also be in significance group a.   

- If there was a treatment that for a "balmy" ambient temperature  (between warm and hot) that did not significantly differ significantly from warm or hot, it would be in significance groups b and c.
