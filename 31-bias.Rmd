**Learning goals: By the end of this chapter you should be able to**    

- Recognize how motivated reasoning can mislead statistics.      
- Recognize when people are studying a question with an incorrect lense / focus.    
- Articulate how societal bias can be reflected in sampling bias, confounded studies and the design of machine learning algorithms.

## Review / Setup   

- So much of stats aims to learn the TRUTH.    

- A major goal of stats is to learn causation.   

- Confounds and bias limit our abilities to make causal claims.

- Rejecting the null model means our null model poorly describes the observations.  

- Stats has a lot of math and computing, but it's hard to math and compute your way out of bias or bad experimental design.  

##  The dark origin of stats   

Statistics was largely founded by people interests in the Eugenics project - A racist program with the goal of "improving the race".  Read more about this history [here](https://nautil.us/issue/92/frontiers/how-eugenics-shaped-statistics) and watch this roundtable aboout past present and future concerns [here](https://harvard.zoom.us/rec/play/dbEAcmuVwfMQphLu385x-Wxc7A2Gnl41Jpl0l0AU5_AWbIUzfnEzXW80l0u8jhnlMFqKIeUvco87dtpu.S1C6VcfNXG2g2RfB?continueMode=true&_x_zm_rtaid=qFgBoRBrQZ-u7FBpMR7SNw.1617219168392.f13bda726c8d3a9bc067e433f276488b&_x_zm_rhtaid=11) if interested. 

##  Poor statistical conclusions motivated by race are common

##  Modern machine learning offers new opportunities for amplifying bias 

Machine learning aims to classify and predict based on some quantitative metrics.  This can solve or amplify issues of bias and confounds.  Unfortunately, it seems like we're heading for the later. Watch these two videos on the topic.
