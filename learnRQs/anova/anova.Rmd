## Setup

Fiddler males have a greatly enlarged "major" claw, which is used to attract females and to defend a burrow. Darnell and Munguia (2011) suggested that this appendage might also acts as a heat sink, keeping males cooler while out of the burrow on hot days. To test this, they placed four groups of crabs into separate plastic cups and supplied a source of radiant heat (60-watt light bulb) from above. The four groups were intact male crabs; male crabs with the major claw removed; male crabs with the other (minor) claw removed (control), and intact female ﬁddler crabs. They measured body temperature of crabs every 10 minutes for 1.5 hours. These measurements were used to calculate a rate of heat gain for every individual crab in degrees C/log minute. 


Rates of heat gain for all crabs are  loaded here as `crabs` but can be downloaded from this [link](https://whitlockschluter3e.zoology.ubc.ca/Data/chapter15/chap15q27FiddlerCrabFans.csv)

#### glimpse

Get a sense of the `crabs` data's  structure with the `glimpse()` function

```{r glimpse, exercise=TRUE, eval = FALSE}

```

I reformat the data  as follows

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
crabs <- crabs %>% 
  mutate(crabType = fct_reorder(crabType, .x = bodyTemperature, .fun = mean, .desc = TRUE))
```

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.heigt = 4.75, fig.width=5.5, echo=FALSE}
a <- ggplot(read_csv("https://whitlockschluter3e.zoology.ubc.ca/Data/chapter15/chap15q27FiddlerCrabFans.csv") %>% na.omit(), 
       aes(x =  crabType, y = bodyTemperature, color = crabType )) +
  geom_jitter(size = 2, alpha = .4, width = .2,height = 0, show.legend = FALSE)   + 
  stat_summary(fun.data = "mean_cl_normal", color = "black")  

b <-  ggplot(crabs,  aes(x =  crabType, y = bodyTemperature, color = crabType )) +
  geom_jitter(size = 2, alpha = .4, width = .2,height = 0, show.legend = FALSE)   + 
  stat_summary(fun.data = "mean_cl_normal", color = "black")  

plot_grid(a,b, labels = c("a","b"), ncol = 1)
```

**HUH**

```{r fct_reorder, echo = FALSE}
question("(Pick the best answer) What did `mutate(crabType = fct_reorder(crabType, .x = bodyTemperature, .fun = mean, .desc = TRUE))` do?",
 answer("Nothing"),
 answer("Changed the y-value"),
 answer("Changed group labels"),
 answer("Ordered groups from highest to lowest temperature", correct = TRUE),
 allow_retry = TRUE,   
  correct = random_praise(),
  incorrect = random_encouragement()
)
```

#### Summarise the data 

Find the mean, variance, and size of each sample  

```{r sum1, exercise=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
crabs %>%
  __() %>%
  __()
```


```{r sum1-solution}
crabs %>%
  group_by(crabType) %>%
  summarise(n = n(),
     mean_temp = mean(bodyTemperature),
     var_temp   = var(bodyTemperature))
```



```{r var, echo = FALSE}

     question("Which group has the greatest variance",
         answer("male minor removed"),
         answer("intact male", correct = TRUE),

  correct = random_praise(),
  incorrect = random_encouragement()),
       question("With this difference in variance among groups, the assumption of homoscedasticity is",
         answer("Probably not a major concern", correct = TRUE),
         answer("Somewhat worrisome, but we can plow ahead anyways"),

## Test 

First, do data match normality assumptions?

```{r nrmassum,  exercise=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(augment(crab_lm), aes(sample = ___))+
  geom_qq() +
  geom_qq_line()
```


```{r nrmassum-solution}

  geom_qq() +
  geom_qq_line()
```




```{r normassump, echo = FALSE}

  answer("Make you run far away from normality assumptions"),
 allow_retry = TRUE,   
  correct = random_praise(),
  incorrect = random_encouragement()

```

```{r, echo = TRUE}
anova(crab_lm)
```


```{r conclude, echo = FALSE}

  answer("Fail to reject the null hypothesis"),
 allow_retry = TRUE,   
  correct = random_praise(),
  incorrect = random_encouragement()),

 answer("All treatments have the same mean"),
 answer("All treatments have different means"),
 answer("Not all treatments have the same mean", correct = TRUE),

```

**Post hoc test**

```{r, echo = TRUE}
aov(bodyTemperature ~  crabType, crabs) %>%
  TukeyHSD() %>%
  tidy()%>% select(contrast, estimate, adj.p.value)
```

```{r posthoc, echo = FALSE}

  answer("FALSE"),
